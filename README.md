# Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Stars-in-The-Office
To address a real-world data science challenge, I'll use the abilities I learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python. I’ll hit “watch next episode” to find if Netflix’s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.   This project allows me to practice an important data science skill: exploratory data analysis, which allows me to execute vital activities like altering raw data and generating inferences from data plots.
